**Now your computer can lose for you**!

##Algorithm

This uses a super-secret hyper-intelligent neural network algorithm recovered from Soviet submarine navigation computers that definitely **doesn't** just check for adjacent matching tiles and makes a random move if it can't find any. As per the Столи́чная act of 1973, you are hereby forbidden from looking at the algorithm in ai.js. Non-compliance is punishable by 10 years forced labour in Siberia.
